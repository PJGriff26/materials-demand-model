Materials Demand Monte Carlo Simulation Model
Stock-Flow Model | 10,000 Iterations | 61 NREL Standard Scenarios | 2026-2050


1. DEMAND MAGNITUDE AND TEMPORAL DYNAMICS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The stock-flow Monte Carlo simulation (10,000 iterations, 61 NREL Standard
Scenarios, 2026-2050) reveals that U.S. clean energy deployment will generate
material demand at industrial scales that challenge existing supply chains.
Across all scenarios, median annual material demand peaks around 2032-2035,
driven by the front-loaded deployment wave required to meet mid-century
decarbonization targets, then declines as the capacity stock matures and net
additions diminish.

Peak-year median demands (2035, all-scenario aggregate):

  Material        Median Demand (tonnes)     95% CI
  ---------------------------------------------------------------
  Steel           1.95 billion               [1.53B, 2.44B]
  Cement          706 million                [544M, 866M]
  Glass           474 million                [426M, 519M]
  Aluminum        134 million                [100M, 235M]
  Copper          45 million                 [24M, 105M]
  Silicon         30 million                 [7.7M, 53M]

Critically, demand is not sustained at peak levels. By 2050, median steel
demand falls to 584 million tonnes (30% of peak), and copper falls to 14
million tonnes (31% of peak). This temporal concentration -- a deployment
"pulse" rather than a plateau -- has important implications for supply chain
investment: infrastructure built to meet 2030s demand may face
underutilization by the 2040s.


2. SUPPLY CHAIN BOTTLENECKS: WHERE DEMAND EXCEEDS PRODUCTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Comparing 2035 median demands to current U.S. production capacity reveals
several materials where projected demand vastly exceeds domestic supply:

  Material        Demand-to-Production Ratio     Import Reliance
  ---------------------------------------------------------------
  Rare Earths     231-391x production            98%
  Vanadium        22-24x production              64%
  Zinc            3.2-5.7x production            81%
  Tin             2.4x production                77%
  Manganese       No domestic production         100%
  Niobium         No domestic production         100%

For bulk materials, the picture is more nuanced. Steel demand (35,590 kMT in
Mid_Case) represents only 43% of current U.S. production capacity (82,980
kMT), suggesting steel is not a binding constraint. Aluminum demand (2,151
kMT) is 87% of domestic production, tight but manageable. However, copper
demand is the critical bulk-material bottleneck: its 95% confidence interval
spans a 4.4x range [24M, 105M tonnes], reflecting deep uncertainty in
material intensity data (87% of copper's total variance is within-scenario,
i.e., driven by intensity uncertainty rather than scenario choice).


3. UNCERTAINTY DECOMPOSITION: WHAT DRIVES DEMAND UNCERTAINTY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The variance decomposition reveals a fundamental structural finding: on a
demand-weighted basis, scenario uncertainty (68.9%) dominates intensity
uncertainty (31.1%), meaning that which energy pathway the U.S. follows
matters more than how much material each MW of capacity requires. However,
this aggregate masks a critical bifurcation:

Materials dominated by scenario uncertainty (>80% between-scenario variance):
  - Manganese (99.7%), Zinc (94.3%), Lead (94.2%), Niobium (94.4%),
    Tin (92.7%), Fiberglass (90.9%), Glass (90.7%), Magnesium (92.7%)
  - These materials have well-characterized intensities but demand volumes
    that depend heavily on which technologies are deployed.

Materials dominated by intensity uncertainty (>70% within-scenario variance):
  - Copper (87.0%), Tellurium (92.4%), Silicon (85.8%), Cadmium (89.9%),
    Praseodymium (95.7%), Dysprosium (96.2%), Gallium (97.7%),
    Selenium (94.2%)
  - For these materials, improving the precision of material intensity data
    would substantially reduce demand forecast uncertainty, regardless of
    scenario.

This has a direct policy implication: for copper and critical minerals like
tellurium and rare earth elements, the marginal value of better engineering
data on material content per MW exceeds the marginal value of scenario
refinement. For steel, cement, and zinc, the reverse is true -- scenario
assumptions drive nearly all uncertainty.


4. SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: WHICH PARAMETERS MATTER MOST
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Spearman rank correlations (n=1,000 Monte Carlo iterations) identify 30
technology-material pairs with strong monotonic relationships (|rho| >= 0.7)
between sampled intensity and resulting demand. The top-ranked parameters by
both Spearman correlation and intensity elasticity converge on the same set
of critical relationships:

Single-source dependencies (rho = 1.0, elasticity = 100%):
  - Selenium, Gadolinium, Gallium --> exclusively from CIGS thin-film solar
  - Yttrium --> exclusively from onshore wind
  - Tellurium, Cadmium --> predominantly from CdTe solar (>91%)

Near-monopoly technology dependencies (rho > 0.97, elasticity > 85%):
  - Zinc: 98% from onshore wind
  - Terbium, Niobium: 93-94% from onshore wind
  - Fiberglass, Lead: 93% from onshore wind
  - Neodymium, Dysprosium: 91% from onshore wind
  - Silicon, Silver, Magnesium: 86-88% from utility-scale solar PV

The dominance of onshore wind as the single largest demand driver for 15+
materials, and utility-scale solar PV for another cluster, means that
technology-specific policy decisions (e.g., favoring offshore vs. onshore
wind, or crystalline silicon vs. thin-film solar) propagate directly into
material demand profiles. A 6/10 agreement rate between the elasticity-based
and Spearman-based rankings confirms the robustness of these findings across
analytical methods.


5. GEOPOLITICAL SUPPLY CHAIN RISK
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The supply chain risk analysis reveals a tiered risk structure:

Extreme risk (composite > 0.80):
  Yttrium (0.95) and Rare Earths (0.81) combine near-total import
  dependence, extreme China concentration (74-94% of imports), high
  geopolitical risk, and high source concentration. These materials are
  used in permanent magnets essential for wind turbines.

High risk (composite 0.40-0.52):
  Manganese (0.52), Niobium (0.50), Chromium (0.45), Tin (0.42),
  Vanadium (0.40) all exhibit 100% or near-total import dependence
  combined with elevated geopolitical risk.

Moderate risk with volume concerns (composite 0.29-0.37):
  Zinc (0.35), Silver (0.37), and Aluminum (0.29) present moderate risk
  profiles but at enormous absolute volumes, where even small supply
  disruptions translate to large tonnage shortfalls.

The intersection of high demand volume, high demand uncertainty, and high
supply chain risk identifies rare earth elements, vanadium, zinc, and
manganese as the materials posing the greatest compounded risk to U.S. clean
energy deployment.


6. SCENARIO CLUSTERING AND POLICY PATHWAYS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

K-means clustering (k=4, silhouette=0.47) partitions the 61 NREL scenarios
into four distinct demand archetypes differentiated primarily by demand
trajectory slope, temporal concentration, and energy storage deployment
fraction:

  Cluster 2 (aggressive decarbonization, e.g., CO2e_100by2035):
    Highest cumulative demand (293M tonnes), peak demand near 98M tonnes,
    high wind penetration. These scenarios front-load deployment most
    aggressively.

  Cluster 3 (high hydrogen / no-IRA scenarios):
    Highest cumulative demand (303M tonnes) but more evenly distributed
    temporally, with lower storage fractions and higher import-exposed
    demand.

  Cluster 1 (baseline / moderate scenarios):
    The largest cluster, moderate demand levels (270M cumulative), peak
    around 2032.

  Cluster 0 (conservative / constrained scenarios):
    Lowest peak demand, but high temporal concentration.

The policy implication: accelerated decarbonization timelines (2035 vs. 2050
targets) do not merely scale demand upward -- they compress the deployment
pulse, creating more acute short-term supply chain stress even if cumulative
demand differs modestly.


7. CONCLUSIONS FOR ENERGY POLICY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Material supply chains will not be the binding constraint for bulk
   materials (steel, cement, glass), where existing production capacity
   exceeds projected demand. However, specialty and critical minerals face
   potential multi-decade bottlenecks that require proactive policy
   intervention.

2. The single most important material supply chain risk is the concentration
   of critical mineral demand in onshore wind technology. Fifteen materials
   derive >80% of their energy-transition demand from onshore wind alone.
   Diversifying technology pathways (offshore wind, alternative generator
   designs, reduced-rare-earth motors) is a direct material security
   strategy.

3. For copper, silicon, and thin-film solar materials, the priority is data
   quality improvement, not scenario analysis. These materials' forecast
   uncertainty is dominated by intensity parameter uncertainty, meaning
   better engineering characterization of material content per MW of
   installed capacity will narrow confidence intervals more than any
   refinement of deployment scenarios.

4. The temporal "pulse" of demand peaking in the early-to-mid 2030s creates
   a planning dilemma: supply chain investments made to meet near-term
   demand spikes may face 50-70% demand declines by 2050 as deployment
   rates mature. Policymakers and industry should plan for a ramp-up /
   ramp-down cycle rather than sustained peak demand.

5. China and geopolitical concentration risk is most acute for permanent
   magnet materials (rare earths, yttrium) essential to wind power. Domestic
   processing capacity, strategic reserves, and allied-nation supply
   diversification are warranted for materials scoring above 0.80 on the
   composite risk index.
